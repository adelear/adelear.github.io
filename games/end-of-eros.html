          <b>My Contributions</b>
        </h3>
        <!-- Multiplayer and Game State Systems -->
        <ul class="w3-ul w3-margin-top">
          <li><b>Multiplayer and Game State Systems</b><br>
            I implemented a round manager system responsible for synchronizing gameplay flow across all connected clients. 
            This system ensured consistent team score tracking, correct transitions between gameplay states, and reliable
            synchronization across networked players using Unity's Photon Fusion. This improved stability and reduced edge-case 
            desynchronization during multiplayer sessions. 
          </li>
          
          <li><b>Player Onboarding and Tutorial Design</b><br>
            To improve first-time player experience, I designed and implemented a dedicated tutorial scene that introduced players
            to the core movement and combat mechanics, player abilities and energy usage, as well as match flow and objectives. 
            This allowed players to learn the mechanics in a controlled environment before entering matches, improving accessibility and player retention.
          </li>

          <li><b>Intro Cinematic</b><br>
            Wrote, drew, and edited the intro cinematic for End of Eros, establishing the game's narrative context. This cinematic was presented upon game startup, 
            and used during public showcases and events to communicate the game's identity to new players. 

            The project was successfully showcased at Toronto FanExpo and the CNE (2024), where I helped present the game, explain systems to players, and gather live feedback from large public audiences.
